#Backbone Todo App
**A home flip tracker** 

As a class we were introduced to Backbone.js. I love the structure that Backbone gives, though the flexibility of it is a little confusing (personally I would rather it see less structure to ensure greater consistency). We had already done a couple of todo apps in class so I started to play with the idea of a home flipper traker (becasue I really enjoy home remodeling). Still needs some work to complete, but it was fun to play around with Backbone.
